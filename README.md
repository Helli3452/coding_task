# coding_task

All code is ine file "coding_task.py". The code is based on the example you provided.

My approach is simply to train a ML model which should learn to distinguish between members and 
non-members. For this added a function to extract features from the dataset.

For the ML model I tried several approaches. All are very basic (not nearly as sophisticated as in the paper I read and 
summarized). This is why the accuracy is also not very good. 

The file "coding_task.py" still contains all3 approaches. Two are commented out. One is run while runtime the file.
This one seems better to me than the first one. In third one was more experimental. The third one is also not computing a
consecutive score but only 0 or 1.

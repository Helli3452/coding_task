# coding_task

All code is in the file "coding_task.py." The code is based on the example you provided.

My approach is simply to train an ML model, which should learn to distinguish between members and 
non-members. For this, I added a function to extract features from the dataset.

For the ML model, I tried several approaches. All are very basic (not nearly as sophisticated as in the paper I read and 
summarized). This is why the accuracy is also not very good. 

The file "coding_task.py" still contains all three approaches. Two are commented out, and one is run while the file is being run.
This one seems better to me than the first one. In third one was more experimental. The third one is also not computing a
consecutive score but only 0 or 1.
However, the one I submit also has some issues, e.g., overfitting.
